/// \brief A compiler front end for the Bond scripting language.
///
/// The FrontEnd manages the interactions between the compiler's front end components, namely a
/// Lexer, a Parser and a SemanticAnalyzer.
///
/// The FrontEnd also manages an input file list, a list of Bond source files that are required to
/// be loaded, parsed and analyzed. Files can be explicitly added to the input file list via the
/// AddInputFile method. Files are also implicitly added to the list when include directives in
/// the Bond source files are parsed. A source file is never added to the input file list more
/// than once, so encountering an include directive for a file that already exists in the list has
/// no effect. One parse tree, rooted with a TranslationUnit, is generated for each Bond source
/// file. Only the TranslationUnits for the files that were explicitly added to the input file
/// list are flagged as requiring code generation.
///
/// When analysis is complete, the list of generated TranslationUnits is returned.
///
/// File loading is delegated to an object that implements the StreamFactory interface so that no
/// assumptions about where the source files reside are made (e.g. disk, network, database,
/// proprietary asset store, etc).
